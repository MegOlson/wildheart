    <p>Hello. I am Jeffery. Such a simple phrase of basic introduction, that we give people all the time; yet the depth of this statement (if ever given the opportunity to reveal), is phenomenal! I think we often hide behind a name, or the common "Hi, how are you" and don't give enough time and effort to the person we are talking to. When do we get real?</p>

    <p>I'm hoping that through Thrive100, we can quit playing "house" and that you will be inspired to tell your story, and allow others to share theirs. It is truly a remarkable thing when you can live as you were created, because there is genuine influence when you are real and transparent. If you can fearlessly share your testimony, trials and victories and simply be who you are today, you can now move others to do the same. We have to choose to stop living as pretentious brainwashed robots, and start living as human beings. It is then, that humanity is revealed and we can begin to understand one another, embrace imperfections and plant seeds of hope. Imagine if we looked past pigmentation and saw God's creation, taking the time to ask, to listen and understand. It's 2017 and I'm done doing things the way they've "always been done." It's time to disregard personal agendas and let love grow.</p>
